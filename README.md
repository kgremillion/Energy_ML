# Machine Learning Meets Energy Share Prices

## Project Question:
### Do external and internal factors have an impact on the share price of Energy companies? If so, which factors are more important?

## Objective:
### Use statisticsal models & Machine Learning libraries to test the relationship between internal/external variables and Energy Company share prices.

## Project Summary:
A million-dollar question is what factors can be used to predict future share prices? Our humble attempt was to brainstorm about what internal & external factors would most likely impact share prices of large Energy companies. Four factors for each was selected:
**Internal:** Revenue, Expenses, Divident Yield, & Cash Flow

**External:** US Interest Rate, US Unemployment Rate, Brent Oil Price, & LNG Price
